# Neon Random

Neon Random is a mod for Neon White, that randomly loads a new level after a set time. If you ever don't know what level to play right now, or are getting burned out from playing one level for hours at a time, this Mod is for you.

### Features
-> Loading Random Level after selected time (only during resetting, do not worry about losing your run)
-> Randomly load new level on button press, if your not happy with the current selection
-> Last Try warning (Press the load new level key during this run to restart the timer)

### Warnings
Do not use if your file does not have all the levels unlocked. I do not know what will happen, at worst it will corrupt your savefile.

## How to install
This mod uses MelonLoader, check the NeonLite readme for installing that, NeonLite is the most important Neon White mod, sou you should probably have that installed as well; this mod should work fine though with only MelonLoader installed and no other mods.
